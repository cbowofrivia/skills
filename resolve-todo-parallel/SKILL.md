Resolve all TODO comments using parallel processing.

## Workflow

### 1. Analyze

Get all unresolved TODOs from the /todos/\*.md directory.

If any todo recommends deleting or removing files that are part of your project's workflow artifacts (e.g. plan files, solution docs), skip it and mark it as `wont_fix`.

### 2. Plan

Create a task list of all unresolved items grouped by type. Look at dependencies that might occur and prioritize the ones needed by others. For example, if you need to change a name, you must wait to do the others. Output a mermaid flow diagram showing how we can do this. Can we do everything in parallel? Do we need to do one first that leads to others in parallel?

### 3. Implement (PARALLEL)

Spawn a general-purpose agent for each unresolved item in parallel.

So if there are 3 items, spawn 3 agents in parallel:

1. Agent(resolve item 1)
2. Agent(resolve item 2)
3. Agent(resolve item 3)

Always run all in parallel subagents for each todo item.

### 4. Commit & Resolve

- Commit changes
- Remove the TODO from the file, and mark it as resolved.
- Push to remote
